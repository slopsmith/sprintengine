// Whether a person can write to an agent a chat's CLI spawned. The box is drawn
// only where a message really arrives, and everywhere else there is no box at
// all, only a bar sending the person to the parent (owner ruling 2026-11-07): a
// box that fails, sits disabled or quietly does nothing is the thing ruled out.
//
// What was proven, with the real Claude Code SDK, asking the parent to use
// SendMessage to the agent's task id: a running background agent, named or not,
// a foreground agent moved to the background first, a nested agent, an Explore
// agent, a finished agent (it is resumed), and a finished agent after the CLI
// process restarted, all received the message. An agent the person stopped did
// not: the CLI refuses it as cancelled. Nothing proved a failed agent, or one
// whose end was never recorded, so those get the bar too.
